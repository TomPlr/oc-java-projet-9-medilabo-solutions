## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Environment Setup

### 1. Root Project .env File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# MySQL Configuration
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
PATIENT_DB_HOST=patient-db
PATIENT_DB_PORT=your_db_port
PATIENT_DB_NAME=patientdb
PATIENT_DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
PATIENT_DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_USER=your_mongodb_username
MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
MONGODB_HOST=your_mongodb_host
MONGODB_DATABASE=your_database_name

# Keycloak Configuration
KEYCLOAK_ISSUER_URI=http://your_keycloak_url/auth/realms/your_realm
KEYCLOAK_JWK_SET_URI=http://your_keycloak_url/auth/realms/your_realm/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

### 2. UI Service .env File
Create a `.env` file in the `services/ms-ui` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Environment
NG_APP_ENV=dev

# Keycloak Configuration
NG_APP_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://your_keycloak_url:8080/
NG_APP_KEYCLOAK_REALM=your_realm
NG_APP_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
NG_APP_KEYCLOAK_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri

# API Configuration
NG_APP_API_GATEWAY_URL=your_gateway_service_url
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd oc-java-projet-9-medilabo-solutions
   ```

2. **Set up environment files**
    - Create and configure both `.env` files as described above
    - Ensure all sensitive information is properly secured
    - Verify all URLs and endpoints are correctly configured

3. **Build and run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   # Build all services
   docker-compose build

   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d

   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. **Access the application**
    - Frontend: http://localhost:4200
    - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080

## üèóÔ∏è Development

### Local Development Setup
1. **Backend Services**
    - Each service can be run independently using Spring Boot
    - Ensure all environment variables are set in your IDE or system
    - Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse with Spring Tools Suite

2. **Frontend Development**
   ```bash
   cd services/ms-ui
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
    - Development server will start at http://localhost:4200
    - Hot reload enabled for development
    - Angular DevTools recommended for debugging

## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Authentication and User Roles

The application comes with two preset user profiles for testing and demonstration purposes:

| Role | Username     | Password  | Permissions  |
| :-------- | :------- | :----------| :----------|
| `manager`      | `jdoe` | `test` | Access to patient management - Ability to modify patient personal data - View medical notes and assessments |
| `medical_staff`| `jadoe` | `test` | Access to medical notes - Ability to add and modify medical comments - Influence patient health assessments - View patient information|

### Role-Based Access Control
The application implements strict role-based access control:
- Managers can modify patient personal information but cannot alter medical data
- Medical staff can add medical comments and influence assessments but cannot modify patient personal data
- Both roles can view patient information and medical history

## üîß Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
1. **Database Connection Issues**
    - Verify database credentials
    - Check network connectivity
    - Ensure database service is running

2. **Authentication Problems**
    - Verify Keycloak configuration
    - Check JWT token validity
    - Ensure proper role assignments

3. **Service Communication**
    - Check service health endpoints
    - Verify network configuration
    - Review service logs
